    summary: "Fresh start.",
    content: "Today was officially the start of our OJT at the BU ICTO. We were introduced to the programming team and we were assigned tasks to work on based on our skills. I was assigned with the backend development of the new BU Faculty Portal. Our first task was to make a Figma wireframe of it before we could proceed to code anything. It was an eventful day, and I'm excited to go through this new experience."

Our initial design of the new BU Faculty Center was turned down since it was not on-theme with the other sites made by the ICTO for use by Bicol University. My initial task remains the same - backend - but I am continually helping with the UI/UX design for mobile and tablet size.",

    content:"Following the completion of the mobile-view design for the BU Faculty Center, my next task was to prepare for its development phase. We were given the initial codebase to work on, followed by setting up the development environment on my local machine. Laravel was relatively new to me, but I already started learning it weeks prior to deployment. This preparation stage was crucial in laying a strong foundation for a smooth and efficient coding process.",

All staff of the office were also called for a meeting in the afternoon to discuss some internal matters.",

    content:"Today I faced a setback. I had problems accessing the contents of the database. It wasn't much an issue with the database itself, but more of me having to find a way to access it through the code. I had to try different things to bypass the errors that were popping up on Livewire. I used a method called 'dd()', introduced to me by Sir Jeff, our direct supervisor, to dump the contents of the database that I needed, to make sure I was properly accessing them before they reach the frontend.",

After 2 days of failed attempts I decided to go for a new approach. I deleted the function that I made and thought of another way to do what I wanted the Livewire component to do and display to the UI.",

I learned something new from it: if there exists a simpler way to do something, always go for that. Coincidentally, I also watched a YouTube video that said almost the same thing. So, starting today, I'll only be focusing on making my code simple, and easy to explain to other devs.",

    summary:"FINALLY DID IT!!",
    content:"Finally, the 3 day struggle came to an end. I made the code work. What was I trying to do anyway, you ask? Well, one of the site's features was having the user encode grades in a CSV file then upload it to the site, and then the grades would be displayed from that file. I initially thought it should be done through Livewire, then when I started rethinking my approach, I decided to let AlpinJS handle taking the data from the file, pass it Livewire, then display it to the UI. AND IT WAS A SUCESS!",

    content:"Today was another day of debugging and fixing features in the Faculty Portal. I felt stressed out again because of all the bugs I was encourtering and the slow load times of the site. The worst part is because we were also fixing some UI interactions, we had to refresh the site everytime a change took place. So, I took a break and helped out wash the dishes at the office, along with 2 others.",

    content:"The past couple of days were spent making a few mistakes here and there, but in the end, the site was almost fully functional. About 95% of all the features that we were tasked -  Omar on the frontend and me on the Backend - were nearly done. Error checks were in place, confirmation buttons, modals, and data displays were all working well. I really felt good about my newfound skills. Though I wouldn't say I'm that proficient yet, it's another step towards understanding the full tech stack being used at the ICTO.",

    content:"Today was another productive day. I made some tweaks to the Livewire component, then I separated the modals code to another folder, then called the respective Blade components in the main UI for the grade encoding page. This'll make the codebase more manageable and easier for new devs/OJT to start working on, by reducing the number of lines of code for each file. After all the tweaks and finalizations were made, we had our work checked and validated with our OJT adviser, Sir Davie. I can say it was a success, with some final reworks to be made next week.",
